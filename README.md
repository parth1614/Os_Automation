Iâ€™ve used JavaScript and RobotJs to write down the script.
One script is used to find the indefinite coordinates where your mouse pointer is currently pointing.
The main script declares the inbuilt RobotJs functions, which trigger mouse moves, keyboard key presses, and browser actions such as opening new tabs, closing tabs, opening pre-entered websites are done through JSON file.


**Add RobotJs to your Linux(Ubuntu-based) using the following command:-
npm install robotjs
